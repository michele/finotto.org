I'm currently working as Lead Backend Developer for [NearIT](https://www.nearit.com/), which is really a blast since I get to work on really intresting problems while playing with all kinds of crazy backend stuff.

I do some [consulting gigs](/consulting) every now and then. And have recently started working on [YAKS](https://yaks.it/) because I couldn't find a good commenting solution for static websites...which I needed for this very website: it probably won't be a blockbuster but it's a ton of fan building it and I got to learn React on the way.

As a father of three little kids, I'm also trying to decode the secrets of parenthood.
