I've been working as a Backend developer for the past 15 years. Started out in PHP — back in the day it was either that or ASP…*sigh* —, I was an early **Ruby on Rails** adopter and now a **Golang** enthusiast.

I love all things backend and I've recently been focused on **microservice** architectures, orchestration using **Kubernetes** and **AWS** ECS, and **scalability**.  
I also quite like to play with databases: I’ve been using **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** for as long as I can remember, often resort to **Redis** to do all kinds of different tricks. Recently started using **DynamoDB**, which I really like.

In the past, I ran my own dev shop with a couple of high school friends and we were the first to build large scale Rails websites in Italy which led to me moderating panels at Pycon Italia and Rails to Italy.

Now a freelancer, currently working as Lead Backend Developer for [NearIT](https://www.nearit.com/), an Italian startup developing a best-in-class contextual mobile engagement platform. Cool product, amazing team, definitely give it a try if you’re in the market for something like it.

If you want to contact me, my email is `m@the-domain-you're-currently-on`. I’m always open to talk about Web development, startups, business ideas.
