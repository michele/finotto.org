I've been working as a Backend developer for the past 15 years. Started out in PHP, I was an early **Ruby on Rails** adopter and now a Golang enthusiast.

I love all things backend and I've recently been focused on microservice architectures, orchestration using Kubernetes and AWS ECS, and scalability.

In the past, I ran my own dev shop with a couple of high school friends and we were the first to build large scale Rails websites in Italy which led to me moderating panels at Pycon Italia and Rails to Italy.
